Q1
_What kind of tourism activity generates the highest income for Scotland?_

TOURIST ACTIVITY highest income. There are data from 2013 CHECK THE DATA. Only inter

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_activities_clean %>%
  select(year,units,value,tourism_activity) %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
  
```
_Filter by year_
```{r}
tourism_day_visits_activities_clean %>%
  select(year,units,value,tourism_activity) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))
```

 _Filter by year_  between 2019 -2013
```{r}
tourism_day_visits_activities %>%
  select(date_code,units,value,tourism_activity) %>% 
  filter(date_code == 2015) %>% 
   arrange(desc(value))
```


Q2 _Which kind of activity generates the most visits to sites?_
# tourism_day_visits_location_clean + tourism_day_visits_activities_clean = answer question2!!!!!!


```{r}
visit_sites_activity
```

 Sites visits by activity. Data from 2013 to 2019


```{r}
visit_sites_activity %>%
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism == 'Visits') %>% 
  filter(type_of_location_visited != 'NA') %>% 
  filter(year ==2013) %>% 
  arrange(year, tourism_activity)
```
There is a 'problem' the maths doesnt work for 2013  the 124 million visits 'All areas' is unequal to the sum of different locations. Without filter NA there are a lot of more information = millions visits lost. I show the first one by year and the first one with tourism activity.

Only tourism_activity
```{r}
visit_sites_activity %>%
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism == 'Visits') %>% 
  filter(type_of_location_visited != 'NA') %>% 
  filter(tourism_activity != 'NA') %>% 
  filter(year== 2013) %>% 
  arrange( tourism_activity)
```
Total vale of All "types_of_location_visited" (124) is different to the independent sum of the each value, check what they say in the web. But I think the answer is that one person can visited multiple location. It is the same even you dont filter NA.  







Q3 _Is there a particular key demographic of visitors we should be focusing on? Who spends the most? Who visits the most?_ 
(30/12/22)Not yet a clear answer

_Understand the data_

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean
```


#  Millions Visits by age.Time range 2013-2019

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =="Visits") %>% 
  filter(age != "All") %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```

# Millions visitis by spend


```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Expenditure') %>% 
  filter(age != "All") %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```

Age or Gender

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Expenditure') %>% 
  #filter(age != "All") %>% 
  filter(gender != "All" ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```
# Marital Status

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Expenditure') %>% 
  #filter(age != "All") %>% 
  #filter(gender != "All" ) %>% 
  filter(marital_status !="All") %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```


```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean %>% 
  select(area, year,measurement,units,value,breakdown_of_domestic_tourism,employment_status) %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Expenditure') %>% 
  #filter(age != "All") %>% 
  #filter(gender != "All" ) %>% 
  #filter(marital_status !="All") %>% 
  filter(employment_status != "All") %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics_clean %>% 
  select(area, year,measurement,units,value,breakdown_of_domestic_tourism,social_grade) %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Expenditure') %>% 
  filter(social_grade != "All") %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```
Funny the most expenditure is the highest grade occupation but the second is in theory the lowest grade occupation ( less money/ less cultured person? assumption)



Q4 = Q2? _What type of locations receive the most visits? What kinds of locations do people spend the most in?_
Maybe the issue is not join tables??




Q5 _Is there a particular method of travel our visitors arrive by? Some of our locations are remote and not easily accessible by public transport, so this would be good information to have_

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_transport_clean
```
```{r}
tourism_day_visits_transport_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Visits') %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_transport_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism =='Expenditure') %>% 
  arrange(desc(value))
```
En 2019 el transporte por avion solo trajo poco menos de millon y medio de visitas ( 10 puesto0) pero a cambio trajo 123 (7 puesto). Planes is more to arrive to any airport and later take a hired vehicle , taxi.... so its a way to arrive to scotland more than travel around the country.

How travel people and their expenditure in relation








Q6 _When looking at regional tourism, what insights can we gain? Where are our visitors from? How do they differ in the money they spend, nights they spend in Scotland, or number of visits they do?_

```{r}
regional_domestic_tourism_clean
```



















Q7 _What type of accommodation is most popular? Is there a difference by location?_


```{r}
scottish_accomodation_occupancy_clean
```

```{r}
scottish_accomodation_occupancy_clean %>% 
  group_by(accommodation_type_and_occupancy) %>% 
  summarise()
  
```

```{r}
scottish_accomodation_occupancy_clean %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  group_by(accommodation_type_and_occupancy) %>% 
  count(accommodation_type_and_occupancy)
 
```



















Q8 _How have general tourism rates changed over time?_
Q9 _Is there any way to predict spending and visits for Visit Scotland?_
Predictions with the occupancy















_varios_


# Understand the missing values = 'All' for the variable 'age' (224 from 308 = 72% !)

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics %>% 
  filter(age == 'All') %>% 
  count()
```

# Check 'age' groups
```{r}

tourism_day_visits_demmographics %>% 
  group_by(age) %>%
  count()
```

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics %>% 
  select(date_code,units,value,breakdown_of_domestic_tourism,age,social_grade) %>% 
  group_by(date_code,age,units) %>% 
  #filter(units == 'million pounds(GBP)') %>% 
  arrange(date_code)
```

Missing where is spent the money?Need another table!!!!!!!!

```{r}
tourism_day_visits_demmographics %>% 
  select(date_code,units,value,breakdown_of_domestic_tourism,age,social_grade) %>% 
  group_by(date_code,age,breakdown_of_domestic_tourism) %>% 
  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism == 'Expenditure') %>% 
  arrange(date_code)
```

 There are 348 NA in 'tourism_activity'
```{r}
tourism_demographic_location_activities %>% 
  filter(is.na(tourism_activity)) %>% 
  count()
```


```{r}
tourism_demographic_location_activities %>%    
  select(date_code,units,value,breakdown_of_domestic_tourism,age, tourism_activity,type_of_location_visited) %>%

  filter(breakdown_of_domestic_tourism == 'Expenditure') %>% 
  arrange(date_code,desc (value))
