# final_project_visit_scotland
 Hi.
 This is my final project for the course Data Analysis at CodeClan Edinburgh in 2022-23.
 I am using the Data from Visit Scotland.
 I got the Data from  'statistics.gov.scot'.
This Data only offer the results from surveys over visits/ expenditure in Scotland from people of Great Britain ( England, Scotland, Wales).
 While there is a reference area for  all GB, England and Scotland, it is missing Wales. This is - in my opinion- a lack of information.
