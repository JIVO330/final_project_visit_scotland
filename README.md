# final_project_visit_scotland
 Hi.
This is my final project for the course Data Analysis at CodeClanEdinburgh in 2022-23.
I am using the Data from Visit Scotland.
I got the Data from  'statistics.gov.scot'.
This Data only offer the results from surveys over visits/ expenditure in Scotland from people of Great Britain ( England, Scotland, Wales).
As far as I understood this Data is no raw, it was already  manipulate(tidy, wrangling..) before offer to the public.
The project is very simple, I did not try to look for tendencies, decision trees or linear regression. My primary intention was answer a few predetermined questions 
While there is a reference area for  all GB, England and Scotland, it is missing Wales. This is - in my opinion- a lack of information.
There are 2 presentations, one done with ioslide and one shorter done with xaringan
